# Week-1: Fraud-Detection
Hi! I am Nishtha. This week I attempted on developing a Fraud Detection System using ML. Began with a dataset from Kaggle, I first went-on with basic data exploration. Although I had begun with writing very basic code fot X,y and training the model, I eventaully progressed a lot, upgrading my code evertime I learnt something new. These transformations helped improve the model slowly and steadily (and it also uplifted my skills in ML).

At my first attempt, I learnt about DecisionTreeRegressor, calculating MAE and fimally predicting the target variable. Later on I understood and even impplemented on how to control the depth of the decision tree, and RandomForestRegressor. These techniques did bring some improvement in the model. Eventually I learnt to deal with missing and categorical values and eventually Pipeline, but then came the most fascinating algorithm of XGBoost. It made realise how various parameters tune to make a model work efficiently and how it's in our hands to control that efficiency. 

Note that I have coded in Kaggle notebook instead of using Google Colab as it is much easier to load a kaggle dataset in kaggle notebook then it is in to load in a colab notebook. Here is the link of the same: [Open Code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nishthagandhix/week-1-fraud-detection)

In a nut-shell, it was great to understand about ML models and discover the various domains they can bring huge impact in. I would be happy to keep working with DSoC for the rest of the weeks!

Thank you
